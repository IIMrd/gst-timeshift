Timeshift GStreamer Plugin

This plugin provides a sink and a source which allow for timeshifting of content coming from a live source. The sink requires timestamped (relative to the base_time of the recording pipeline) buffers. The source will allow seeking between the recorded buffers. 

NOTE:
plugins can be installed locally by using "$HOME" as prefix:

  $ meson --prefix="$HOME" build/
  $ ninja -C build/ install

However be advised that the automatic scan of plugins in the user home
directory won't work under gst-build devenv.
